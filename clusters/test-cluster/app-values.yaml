apps:
#   below is an example of how to specify an app
#   name of the argocd application
#   - name: "app"
# 
#     when true, will disable auto-sync and auto-heal on the argocd app
#     disableAutomated: false
#
#     name of the chart to install - corresponds with chart name in charts/apps/
#     chartName: argocd
#
#     namespace where the chart contents will be installed to
#     namespace: argocd
#
#     (optional) can define the git SHA to sync against specific to the app
#     This overrides global.spec.targetRevision
#     targetRevision: main
